How to Play:

7 different tetris objects will 'fall' one at a time on the matrix.
Use the left, right, up, and down arrow keys to either move the
tetris object or rotate it, respectively. 

Points are awarded for every row that is cleared. Rows are cleared by
manipulating the objects so that they fill a horizontal row. Only when every
square of the row has been filled will the player receives points.
